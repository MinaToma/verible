`verible-verilog-kythe-extractor` extracts indexing facts from a collection of
SystemVerilog source files, following the [Kythe](http://kythe.io) schema. The
indexing data can drive interactive capabilities such as linking definitions and
cross references for easy navigation, and even name completion in editors.
