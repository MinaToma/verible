The style linter analyzes code for patterns and constructs that are deemed
undesirable according to the implemented lint rules.

## Lint Rules

User documentation for the lint rules is generated dynamically, and can be found
at https://google.github.io/verible/verilog_lint.html, or by running
`verible-verilog-lint --help_rules` for text or `--generate_markdown`.
